I am really glad we have hired you. Everything goes as expected.

To the point.

Press SPACE to fire. Well  - Mike was in a hurry and we have this white rectangles instead of bullets.
Could you please replace them with a proper graphics? Maybe this will help you:

> `Entities/Bullet.js` is the file. There is also `images/spritesheet.png` file that contains the bullet graphics (these little blue and red balls). I've heard that this game will have to support two players at later stage - you can get a bullet team accessing `this.team` (0 blue, 1 red). I already have what you are looking for in `Entities/Ship.js`

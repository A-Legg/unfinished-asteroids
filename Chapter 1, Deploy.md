Glad you have decided to join the team.

The game has to run in a browser - hence Mike started to write it in javascript/html5 stack.

[Download](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids/archive/master.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids) the project and put it on your webserver.

I hope you are familiar with that - but just in case - you can use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html) or find some [free web hosting](https://www.google.pl/search?q=free+online+hosting&oq=free+online+hosting&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=0&ie=UTF-8&gws_rd=ssl#q=free+web+hosting).

When you upload the game where it should be - just navigate to folder `/www` through your web browser.

Take your time... but please remember that we are quite near the deadline.

If you have questions just [post some issue](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids/issues)

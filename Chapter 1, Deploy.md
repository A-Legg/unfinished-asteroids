Glad you have decided to join the team. My name is Joshua Hal and I am a producer in this company. 

The game has to run in a browser - so Mike has started to write it in javascript/html5 stack.

[Download](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids/archive/master.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids) the project and put it on your webserver.

Or you can just run `index.html` if you are not familiar with web hosting. 

Take your time... but please remember that we are quite near the deadline.

If you have questions just [post some issue](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids/issues)

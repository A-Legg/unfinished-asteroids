Hello there, 

Thanks for dropping us the portfolio of yours. Your timing was perfect - we are urgently looking for another programmer.

We have a game to finish for our client. Mike who was a programmer on this project - could make this very basic prototype but we had to move him to another project. It is a simple asteroids like game and I belive you will have no troubles finishing it.

Here is a spritesheet to get you hyped!

If you are fancy working with us - pick a first task from the list to the right.

Cheers!

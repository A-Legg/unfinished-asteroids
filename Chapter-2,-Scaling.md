Have the setup gone well? 

You have probably noticed that the game is running in a small window which is quite not acceptable.

Here are the requirements:

* Desired resolution 640x480
* It's a pixelart game so we don't want smoothing and antialising
* The game should scale to fill up the whole window

I have asked Mike to give you some advices and this is his reply: 

> You can find the main file in `script/App.js` - we are using playground.js and you should be able to figure out what to do from [their docs on scaling](http://canvasquery.com/playground-scaling).

Again [fill up an issue](https://github.com/rezoner/unfinished-asteroids/issues) if you run into problems

Good luck!
